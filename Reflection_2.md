# Data Reflection 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Banks and financial institutions are highly reliant on trained models to determine which transactions are fraudulentâ€”many banks even offer credit transaction monitoring, alerting the consumer when they recognize a transaction as atypical for their spending habits. As the physical EMV chip technology develops and starts to take over the magstripe of older cards, models behind the scenes are also working towards increasing security and protections for consumers. The SPD Group Credit Card Fraud Detection project aimed to bring machine learning into this process.

Standard fraud detection may miss many of the patterns that machine learning enhanced detection can pick up, takes more time, and it is more reliant on user feedback. At worst, protection systems are prohibitive and require the user to enter in some form of identification such as an SSN or set limits on spending. Machine learning driven protection utilizes neural networks to do most of the analysis and is broken down into two parts: data mining and pattern recognition from previous transaction history.

Several different methods of classifying the models are available but are largely grouped into supervised and unsupervised models. Unsupervised models utilize unlabeled data which requires less preprocessing. This includes PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which analyzes variables within the data and finds an acceptable variability, LOF (Local Outlier Factor) which returns a probability that a data point is an outlier through density with other data points, one-class SVM which trains only on small legitimate transactions and then compares to find anomalies, and an Isolation Forest which is built upon split random decisions. Supervised models use labels in training data and predict the labels of new, unseen data. Examples are K-Nearest Neighbors which places data into clusters in a multi-dimensional space and makes decisions upon proximity, XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) which is a subset of decision trees algorithms, and Random Forest which takes advantage of the strength of random sampling.

Overall, a combination of classification algorithms (as opposed to anomaly detection algorithms) were most effective in detecting fraud. They further decided that if the probability of fraud is less than 10%, the transaction is allowed, between 10% and 80% another authentication method would be required, and a greater than 80% chance would freeze and require manual review. Practices such as these can end up saving companies costs in customer service and increase favorability among competitors.
