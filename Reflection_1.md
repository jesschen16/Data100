# Data Reflection 1

As opposed to standard programming which typically outputs some processed information based upon certain rules applied in the program, machine learning aims to output the results of rules found in a set of data without being given the rules. Neural networks make up the logic that guesses at the rules present in the original data. Each network is made up of three components: neurons (what performs the math and takes inputs/produces outputs), layers (your data points at each generation), and dense (the set of connections between neurons on different generations). 
One application of machine learning (more specifically, computer vision) is classifying bird species by image. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology has a library of photos categorized not only by species, but also by sex, age, color morphs, for a total of 555 groupings. The user compared the accuracy of all 555 classes between three different EfficientNet models (convolutional neural networks) of different sizes that correlate to different resolutions (224x224, 300x300, and 600x600). Of all the images in the dataset, roughly half were used to train the models and run through 300 epochs, in other words, run through and trained 300 times. 
Training photos were cropped to exclude the background using pre-set bounding boxes. For test data, the article tested between four different options: rescale to fit training image size and pad with a black border, rescale only the image in the bounding box to the fit the size and pad with a border, no preprocessing, and only the raw image in the bounding box. Between the rescaled photos, ones cropped by the bounding box had typically 9-10% better accuracy in all resolutions than only rescaled images. Among photos that werenâ€™t rescaled, accuracy also goes down by 9-10%. Through all the models and image types, article ultimately concluded that image resolution has a greater effect on accuracy than model size.
