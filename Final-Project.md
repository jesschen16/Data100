The municipality of Esbjerg has a population of 116,705 people and seven distinct urban areas. The city for which the municipality is named is the largest most densely populated  area at 1635/km^2 in the top left corner. The other major urban centers include Bramming, Ribe, Grestedbro, and the neighboring areas of the city Esbjerg in order from highest to lowest density. The shp file I used categorizes roads by OpenStreetMap classifications of roads linked [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway). I mapped roads down to the secondary level, including linking roads such as ramps and sliproads. The most significant roads branch out from the city of Esbjerg as expected, and connect to Bramming and Grestedbro, but not strangely down to Ribe. A singular motorway or trunk leads out of Esbjerg, but several other primary roads lead out of the region.
